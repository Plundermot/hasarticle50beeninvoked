## Updates

When (or if) article 50 is invoked, a timely [update to the index file](https://github.com/rooreynolds/hasarticle50beeninvoked/edit/master/index.html) changing the 'no' to a 'yes' would be especially helpful.

When making your change, please include in the desciption field a link to some evidence that article 50 has indeed been invoked.

Thank you.
